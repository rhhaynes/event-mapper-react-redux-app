# event-mapper-react-redux-app

React-Redux application with a Rails API backend for visualizing weather and geological
databases. Based on user requests, the client-side application fetches geolocation data
from the API server and overlays it on Google Maps.

At present users can view Atlantic hurricane paths from 1995-2017 based on Weather Underground,
the entire Volcano World database maintained by Oregon State University, and realtime earthquake
data made available by the United States Geological Survey.
